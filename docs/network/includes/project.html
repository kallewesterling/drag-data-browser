<h6>How It Started</h6>
<p>This project started as a part of my Ph.D. dissertation's research inquiries into historical data in attempts to find queer foundational structures in popular entertainment through social network analysis. Originally funded as a funded through a Connect New York grant in Summer 2018, I was able to begin creating a dataset that linked drag and “pansy” performers in New York City to burlesque theatres and nightclubs in the 1920s–30s. The research was primarily based on the archives of Billboard and Variety as they exist in their entire runs in ProQuest’s Entertainment Archive database. I also started mapping theatres and other venues where such performers regularly appeared.</p>
