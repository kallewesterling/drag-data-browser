Morris is mentioned in an anecdote concerning Rags Ragland but this entry does not mention his signature drag striptease; see “Ragland, Rags,” in <em>Vaudeville Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America</em>, ed. Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, and Donald McNeilly, vol. 1 (New York, NY: Routledge, 2007), 913. Most centrally, Morris and his acts were described in Herbert M. Alexander, <em>Strip Tease: The Vanished Art of Burlesque</em> (New York: Knight Publishers, 1938). Alexander’s text will be highly important later in this chapter."

In this case, I want to honor Nazi Mova’s and Lena Rivers’s seeming wishes to keep their deadname a secret. Using deadname as a term here also points out the potential damage that a historiographic gaze can do by outing historical performers against their will, similar to the warning on ibid., 90: “The media [in this case, historiography] has a tendency to report on trans people’s deadnames under the pretense of ‘providing all the facts,’ but the majority of the time a deadname is not relevant information.” In Mova’s and Rivers’s cases, their campily-referenced names should be considered their “real” names.

    "Here-We-Are": {
        "fullReference": "I have identified three other options for the song. A likely contender is Irving Berlin’s song “Here We Are,” written for the 1930 Warner Brothers film <em>Mammy</em>. See “Mammy,” <em>The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin</em>, eds. Robert Kimball and Linda Emmet, 260. Mammy was an attempt to follow up The Jazz Singer with another musical film, and became a hit, despite “musicals . . . beginning to lose their vogue with audiences.” See Susan King, “Rare Al Jolson movie ‘Mammy’ now on DVD,” <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, April 6, 2010, https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-apr-06-la-et-mammy6-2010apr06-story.html. The script from the film, unfortunately, does not contain any lyrics: “The troupe is standing and singing the opening number: ‘HERE WE ARE’. When the song is ended, Westy steps forward…” See Joseph Jackson, Irving Berlin, and Gordon L. Rigby, “Mammy 1930: Shooting Script” (Warner Brothers, 1930; Electronic Edition by Alexander Street Press, 2009), 61. Another contender is a song, “Here We Are In Love,” from the 1932 musical <em>Marching By</em>. Since the musical only ran for 12 performances, it was not likely the song sung at the Echo Tavern. See Dan Dietz, <em>The Complete Book of 1930s Broadway Musicals</em> (Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2018), 193. A third option is “Here We Are Together,” a song from the 1933 musical revue <em>Tattle Tales</em> with lyrics by Frank Fay and William Walsh, and music by Edward Ward. However, the song was added during its brief 28 performance run and it is not likely that it would have the popular appeal that a song in a Playboy Revue likely had. Hanshaw, however, was popular at the time and appeared frequently on the radio, see “Outstanding Program on the Air,” <em>Variety</em>, August 8, 1933, 36; “Annette Hanshaw Leaps From $250 to $1,400 Wkly,” <em>Variety</em>, September 4, 1934, 34."

The authorities tried to shut down the grill’s show in January 1935 and in May, they booked the owners on four charges of breaking the law that regulated his liquor license, none of which were related to presenting the show, but the raid happened on the opening night of the show.
