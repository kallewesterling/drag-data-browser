This work of designing occupies much of his time and so successful has he been in this work, that often times he is asked to assist in the designing work of gowns for the featured women of the bigger New York stage productions.

He's going to display it at Friday's matinee and it'll be worth the time of the style-minded ladies to take a look at it, we think. What does he do? He's a female impersonator and just about perfect at it. There's Queen Marie as big as life and nineteen times as entertaining. There's the 'Red Book cover' lady.
