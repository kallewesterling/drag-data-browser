        <li>"Jean Malin is returning to his cinema city night club . . . at the request of the flicker stars who miss him . . . Jean is trying to get Jackie Maye and Francis Dunn out there to work with him." (Daily News, 39)</li>
        
        <li>"Billy Bryant, who came to town as a legendary show-boat figure of the Ohio and Mississippi, winds up in night club—and in the same show, at the Club Richman, is that wise cracking effeminate master-of-ceremonies, Jean Malin . . . Yes, Broadway makes strange floorshow fellows." (In New York (Gilbert Swan) syndicated column Public Opinion, 10 (449876950); 1932-03-06 Pensacola News Journal, 4 (352595871); 1932-03-07 Muncie Evening Press, 4 (249257561); 1932-03-07 The Rock Island Argus, 6 (507720901); 1932-03-08 The Newark Advocate, 4 (287814763); 1932-03-09 The Selma Times-Journal, 4 (570056313); 1932-03-10 The Bristol News Bulletin, 4 (584841378); 1932-03-10 The Plain Speaker, 4 (500330179); 1932-03-11 Arizona Daily Star, 10 (163923014); 1932-03-15 Leader-Telegram, 8 (267095876); 1932-03-15 The Whittier News, 10 (627083000); 1932-03-22 The Ventura County Star and the Ventura Daily Post, 4 (628448677))</li>

        <li>"Jean Malin's burlesque radio number is one of the high spots of the new show at the Club Richman" (New York Daily News, ??? (414556477))</li>
        
        <li>"At the Club Argonaut, Jean Malin still continues to be the big attraction of Broadway's night life. Now a swell floor show has been built around Mr. Malin (am I getting personal?) and I especially recommend the 'Love for Sale' number. (New York Daily News, 31)</li>
        
        <li>"Most of his spare time in the [Belasco] theatre was utilized by him to sew dresses for the soirees at Rockland Palace, the Harlem Casino and other spots of that type. Dressed as a woman, Malin was a consistent winner of first prizes in these contests." (New York Daily News, 35 (416445086); 1933-08-15 Detroit Free Press, 17 (97646094); 1933-08-15 The St. Louis Star and Times, 4 (205476186))</li>
        
        <li>". . . Jean Malin is the chief attraction for the naughtic clan." (New York Daily News, 36)</li>
        
        <li>"After watching Jean Malin work for a while Saul said: 'I don't understand why you columnists call him 'Man or Myth?' He's just a performer."; "'Just wait until we hear the 'Love for Sale' number. Then we leave and go to the Calais club.'" (New York Daily News, 53)</li>
        
        <li>His age corroborated from http://sfbaytimes.com/jean-malin-broadways-queen-of-queens-2/ (obituary)</li>
        
        <li>misspelled as "Jean Mallin" (Pansy' Places on Broadway, Variety, Sept. 10, 1930, 1)</li>
        
        <li>"a female impersonator of no small ability who acts as master of ceremonies and who, just a few years ago, was just another shrinking violet. Mallin [sic] has been a 'wow' as a box office attraction and is mentioned almost daily by the out-and-out Broadway paragraphers." (Star-Gazette, 6; Fitchburg Sentinel, September 29, 1930, 6; The Meriden Daily Journal, October 3, 1930, 10)</li>
        
        <li>"has returned as master of ceremonies and is supervising a star-studded show" (The Billboard, April 15, 1933, 19)</li>
        
        <li>"held over for another two weeks at the Ship Cafe in Venice" (The Billboard, August 12, 1933, 11)</li>

        <li>"booked by Jack Bertell into the New Yorker Club . . . . has ignored the agent's claim for commissions, according to . . . Bertell's lawyer. Agent is also contemplating suit for commissions on a movie contract which was the result of the club showing." He was also, according to Variety, Mar 21, 1933, 50, sued for rent that he did not pay. Also see Variety, Jun 20, 1933, 32 for follow up and Variety, Jul 11, 1933, 47 for the dropping of the suit. (The Billboard, Mar 4, 1933, 5)</li>
        
        <li>"The common or garden variety of chorus boy is played by the well-known Jean Malin with his own inimitable floruishes." (The Billboard, Nov 1, 1930, 32)</li>
        
        <li>"(both of 'em [Jean Malin and Jackie Maye] flaming femme impersonators), we can't help but wonder whatever happened to that police edict barring female impersonators from the local nite clubs—you know, the edict that got so much publicity immediately after the Club Abbey shooting." (The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, March 21, 1931, 9)</li>
        
        <li>"Healy will leave the Club New York in two weeks to be replaced by Jean Malin." (The Hollywood Reporter, March 23, 1933, 3)</li>
        
        <li>"is doing Queen Victoria [at Club New Yorker] these nights" (The Hollywood Reporter, Oct 1, 1932, 2)</li>
        
        <li>"Were you at the Club New Yorker the other eve when Jean Malin announced that he 'was all fagged out'? Whoops!" (The Hollywood Reporter, September 29, 1932, 2)</li>
        
        <li>giving an impersonation of Aimee Semple McPherson that is something (times daily news (NC) 11-21-32)</li>
        
        <li>"Jean Malin and his floor show return to that spot." (Variety, Apr 4, 1933, 41)</li>
        
        <li>"Jean Malin keeps on climbing! In the tryout of 'Sisters of the Chorus,' he had a small part, having previously been a dancer in ensembles. Since them he attracted throngs to the now defunct Robaiyat, and became the star attraction at the Abbey. Having made a hit with his distinctive personality, he returns to 'Sisters of the Chorus' for the New York engagement, this time . . . . doubling at the Abbey. Texas Guinan returns to the Abbey shortly, Jean will move to the Chateau Madrid." (Variety, April 30, 1930, 54)</li>
        
        <li>"Tex Guinan accepted a hurry-up booking for Fanchon & Marco . . . Tex has left her nite club. Jean Mallin [sic] replaces her as hostess." (Variety, Mar 4, 1931, 40)</li>
        
        <li>"will impersonate Mae West" (Variety, May 30, 1933, 30)</li>
        
        <li>"filed a suit for divorce" in Mexico! (Variety, November 22, 1932, 44)</li>
        
        <li>"Malin gives all the acts a break, builds them up well and allows them to work without interference, something local club m. c.'s should learn. In his own work, he's still the town's hot boy as far as wisecracking is concerned but the local wisecrackers are laying off him. Took the count too often, No small aid to Malin is his piano player, Charlie Russell." (Variety, November 29, 1932, 55)</li>
        
        <li>"very New York, landed solidly both with those who knew him from the east and with the local filmites. His wise cracks and flip remarks, especially to noisy guests, had the home girls and boys wondering what it was all about."; "Malin takes up about half of the floor show time with his femme impersonations. A class entertainer, he shows most of the local cafe performers how it should be done. He's at his best when being fed by Jack Oakie, Polly Moran, William Haines or some of the other picture names who are nightly patrons." (Variety, Oct 4, 1932, 52-53)</li>
        
        <li>"Backstage mixed with the underworld . . . a pansy who 'never resists police.' It's a lingering drama that should not hang around long. . . . Jean Malin's the pansy. The m.c. of the Club Abbey does his usual violet routine, and in an experienced manner doesn't act like a man for some laughs and more curiousity from a motley array of cut-raters who will come here when they do. That's no break for the club that screams credit for itself for Malin in the program. . . . Malin's job is wrist slapping once or twice through each act dropping a wisecrack and a gesture." (Variety, October 29, 1930, 71)</li>
