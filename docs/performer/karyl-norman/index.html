    <ul>
        
        <li>3 year contract (Philadelphia Inquirer, January 2, 1921, page unknown)</li>
        
        <li>stopped his act halfway because he was not receiving enough applause - he was later rebuked for his action and the head of the Keith Circuit wrote "informing him in part he would never again be afforded an opportunity to criticize any audience in any of the houses on the Keith Circuit." (- norman-karyl-041223 + norman-karyl-041923, April 12, 1923)</li>
        
        <li>"Karyl Norman next proved himself the king of female impersonators, or should we have said queen? It's so hard to get your genders straight in a case like this. He wears dazzling gowns most fetchingly and we don't think it amiss to add naturally. He also sings in a very feminine voice when he wills and in a very masculine voice as well. Quite an accomplishment. He got a rousing reception." (—————————, June 14, 1924)</li>
        
        <li>"following a contract with the [Keith] vaudeville people for a period of five years, has walked out on them and is now playing motion picture house dates. That he will not return to vaudeville seems to be definite, inasmuch as he has signed with Abe Carlos for a series of feature pictures and will make personal appearances in conjunction with these productions when they are released." (Variety, May 5, 1926, page unknown)</li>
        
        <li>"seen at the Columbia for the past several years, has evidently quit the vaudeville stage for the present . . . signd with Abe Carlos, husband of Gilda Gray to do a number of feature pictures." (Davenport IA Democrat, November 5, 1926, page unknown)</li>
        
        <li>". . . about to start on a tour of the Fox Houses around New York. For many seasons Keith-Albee and the Orpheum circuits have utilized Norman as a headliner. Seeing no farther benefit to himself in clinging to three-a-day time at two-a-day salary, Norman has taken the jump." (Variety, November 30, 1927)</li>
        
        <li>originally scheduled to appear but was "pulled out yesterday" (Billboard, June 21, 1930, 16 (Vaudeville Reviews: The Palace, New York))</li>
        
        <li>"reverts to a bygone vaudeville program . . . Norman appears to depreciate the old type turn to the extent that he is not a 'female impersonator,' but rather a 'character delineator.'" (- norman-karyl-072330, July 23, 1930)</li>
        
        <li>"has been handed his notice at the Club New Yorker and washes up with the club when Ted Healy and his gang arrive here from New York to replace him." (Hollywood Reporter, February 16, 1933, 3)</li>
        
        <li>"the Creole Fashion Plate, headlines the stage show at the Fox. . . . The world-famous female impersonator carries 35 beautiful gowns for his act and wears a different creation at every performance." (Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York)June 10, 1934, BC9)</li>
        
        <li>"Headliner of the bill is Karyl Norman. He trips buxomly to the microphone in the last trappings of femininity with all the aplomb of the night club divas, and in a clear soprano head-voice sings sweetly of love and laughter. The payoff comes when he sweeps off the wig and unleashes a mighty baritone. His impersonation of Mae West was also received in gasping admiration. Mr. Norman parodies all the flutterings of the night club entertainers with biting irony and through it all succeeds in keeping the game clean." (Gazette, March 5, 1935, 14)</li>
        
        <li>"The chef who mixed up the concoction for the Majestic patrons, is a past master in the art of serving real food for tired people. . . . The meat of the bill is Karyl Norman, 'the creole fashion plate', and one of America's foremost female impersonators. He is ably aided and abetted in his delectable offering 'In Rehearsal' by Bob Hamil who tickles the ivories for his many delightful vocal numbers." (Morning Call, May 15, 1935, 12)</li>
        
        <li>"Heading the stage end of the delightful program that has been arranged . . . is none other than Karyl Norman, one of the world's foremost female impersonators. Assisting this versatile stars in his offering which he calls 'In Rehearsal', is Bob Hamil. He was a big hit at all of yesterday's performances with his voice and immaculate female attire." (News, May 15, 1935, 10)</li>
        
        <li>"'Creole Fashion Plate' . . . Keith and vaudeville headliner for 14 years, and who was starred on Broadway in 'Greenwich Village Follies,' 'That's My Boy,' and 'Lady Do,' will bring his revue to New lookout House for a brief engagement beginning THursday night. 'The Creole Fashion Plate' makes 20 complete changes and carries a $20,000 wardrobe. This will be his first time in Greater Cincinnati in eight years. The resent floor show . . . will continue until Wednesday night. There will be another amateur contest tomorrow night." (Cincinnati Enquirer, July 21, 1935, 46)</li>
        
        <li>"known as 'The Creole Fashion Plate,' opens a brief engagement Thursday night in Terrace Garden, New Lookout House. 'The Creole Fashion Plate' is coming from New York, bringing his extensive wardribe with which to make 20 complete costume changes. This female impersonator imitates Mae West, Anna Mae Wong and other notables, and will be seen here with his own revue." (Cincinnati Enquirer, July 22, 1935, 6)</li>
        
        <li>"the 'Creole Fashion Plate,' female impersonator extraordinary, is featured at the Bradford Cascades atop the Hotel Bradford this week with a scintillating floor show. Norman, now the tops in his art, dons the latest creations and many 18th century gowns, and fools even the ladies with his perfect impersonations." (Boston Globe, March 18, 1936, 21)</li>
        
        <li>"The Creole Fashion Plate", "The World's Greatest Female Impersonator" (New Castle PA News, November 3, 1936, 6)</li>
        
        <li>"He will sing in two voices and tell why movie producers say 'he looks more like Mae West than Mae'." (Pittsburgh Press, November 17, 1936, 22)</li>
        
        <li>"billed as 'The Creole Fashion Plate,' is the best known member of the company. He has played big time vaudeville in New York and elsewhere for years." (Fort Worth TX Star-Telegram, December 15, 1936, 22)</li>
        
        <li>"The veteran Karly [sic] Norman, a female impersonator, won the plaudits of the crowd in the 'Creole Fashion Plate,' billed as the top act." (Des Moines Register, November 20, 1937, 12)</li>
        
        <li>"Karyl Norman, female impersonator, who headlined vaudeville a decade ago, returned to Des Moines via burlesque to obtain thorough approval of the President theater audience Friday night. Billed as 'The Creole Fashion plate,' his impersonation of the 'strip tease act' proved a fitting mimic to the number of like acts offered by the fair ladies of the east." (Des Moines Tribune, November 20, 1937, 3)</li>
        
        <li>has discarded wigs for Tux and straight baritone singing (Variety, July 19, 1939, 37 (Vaude-Night-Clubs: Karyl Norman, Who Once Meant Big B.O. in Cleve., Brought Back by Jabin))</li>
        
        <li>"Under the leadership of Karyl Norman, master of ceremonies, the members of the cast will offer new songs, dances and comedy" (Detroit Free Press, January 18, 1940, 19)</li>
        
        <li>"Twenty-one years in show business have given Karyl Norman, master of ceremonies and producer and singing star of Club Frontenac's revues, ample experience for any job. Norman joined a minstrel show in Baltimore when he was 15 years old. Since that time he has appeared as a headliner in vaudeville, starred in musical comedy and for the last five years has been in the cabaret field." (Detroit Free Press, February 7, 1940, 12)</li>
        
        <li>"continues to be featured" (Detroit Free Press, March 21, 1940, 15)</li>
