        <li>"Gowns, representing an expenditure of more than $4,000 within the last year, are worn by Francis Renault, the stage's foremost impersonator of women characters who is headlining the Pantages vaudeville program this week and each gown and head-dress worn in the course of the act, is the creation of Mr. Renault, his manager explained. Unlike many impersonators of female performers, Renault does not depend upon his attire to carry him over. True, he wears gowns and headdress creations equal of which are seldom seen upon a vaudeville stage, but it is ability to sing in a soprano voice, his ability to pitch his voice into an effeminite [sic] key, and his grace of figure and carriage which combine to score his stage triumphs. In his dressing rooms back stage at Pantages, Mr. Renault has 11 trunks and each contains many gowns, each representing hours and days of study in designing. This work of designing occupies much of his time and so successful has he been in this work, that often times he is asked to assist in the designing work of gowns for the featured women of the bigger New York stage productions. Renault was the first vaudeville star to introduce the radium gown and in the 'Passing Show' in which he was featured with Willie and Eugene Howard, his display of gowns and head pieces was featured. In his Pantages appearance, Mr. Renault sings, dances and gives a comedy monologue." (Star Tribune, January 19, 1930, 6)</li>
        
        <li>"Renault, it transpires, is a 'former Ziegfeld Follies star, who has been named as correspondent in three divorce actions, wooed by the emperor, assaulted by enraged wives and has been dubbed 'the mystery of science and sex.' His tricks run from an imitation of Mae West to Mary Pickford." (The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, September 16, 1949, 14)</li>

        <li>"We came out of this performance with a smile from ear to ear. By all means time yourself so that you can leave at the close of this act. Don't let anything spoil the excellent taste it leaves. Now, just a minute—don't get us all wrong. There wasn't a whole lot of applause, but we believe there was more than for any act in the last three weeks. Personally, we haven't enjoyed ourself [sic] so much since away back in November when a pair of superb Spanish dancers performed. This man is superior. He has a high class of humor so seldom found that it is delicious. We would enjoy seeing him again. He is said to have a $50,000 wardrobe and we believe it. He's going to display it at Friday's matinee and it'll be worth the time of the style-minded ladies to take a look at it, we think. What does he do? He's a female impersonator and just about perfect at it. There's Queen Marie as big as life and nineteen times as entertaining. There's the 'Red Book cover' lady. There's Madame Butterfly, and an opera singer. If you are one of those who is discriminating and hard to please, here's your act. We don't know how it strikes the average theater goer, but to the particular it is splendid." (The Daily Times, January 30, 1930, 7)</li>
        
        <li>"With his wardrobe costing $50,000 including new gowns, millinery, shoes, hosiery, lingerie, and jewelry, Francis Renault, famous female impersonator will headline the RKO vaudeville bill. Promenading and posing are said to be only a part of his routine which consists of new songs and dances." (The Des Moines Register, February 16, 1930, Section 10)</li>
